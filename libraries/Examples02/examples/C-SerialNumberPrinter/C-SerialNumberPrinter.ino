/*
  
  NOTE: This sketch is only interesting if you have a Blinks Dev Candy adapter connecting
  the blink to your serial port!
  
  Every blink tile comes into this world with its own untique serial number.
  
  This sketch prints the current tile's serial number out to the serial port.
  
  The serial number is 9 bytes long, and is printed with hex numbers like this...
  
  "For a good time, call:39-11-1-50-4E-38-33-33-39"
  
    ...or...
    
  "For a good time, call:30-20-3-50-4E-38-33-33-39"

  The first bytes are more likely to be different than the last bytes, in case
  you can't remember the whole thing (it is long).
